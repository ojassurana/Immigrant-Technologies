## Introduction

India went through a huge spike in Covid-19 cases in the form of a second wave.Making resources even more scarce then it already was Unfortunately, due to just an overall lack in resources, the Indian people were driven into desperate measures to obtain resources to keep themselves and their loved ones alive.
Indian social media, which was the only platform people could turn to, was filled with cries for help.
Donation requests for necessities such as oxygen tanks and hospital beds accompanied with contact details were a common sight on every social media platform.  
We came to realise that this way of communication between donees and donors has its inadequacies. 
It presents a difficulty for a connection between donors and donees to be formed. 
Let’s say you are a donor who can only provide remedisvir in your city(delhi), won’t it be more efficient if you can just get a list of donees who require remedisvir in Delhi specifically instead of being constantly bombarded with irrelevant posts.
